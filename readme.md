Created by Daniel Kravec, on July 9th, 2022


## Version history
### v1.0 (1.2022.07.09)
- 2 render options, small and colourful gradient, or larger black and white gradient.
- Express application, with web and backend options.

### v1.0 (2.2022.07.10)
- You can now save the images, press button, opens new tab, and save as image.
- Added v3-v6 renders, different designs.
- created /example_renders so you can check out the different designs/renders.

### v1.0 (3.2022.07.10)
- Moved each render into a new file.
- One file compiles all possible files within /imageRenders, and sends them to api, which can choose the function to take.
- Created v7+v8 renders.

Problems, render can run out of memory to render. (maybe use c# instead for calucations)
